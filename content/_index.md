title = "Workshop on The Promises and Perils of Parallelizing Sequential Computation"
+++


# Abstract

Parallel hardware has reshaped the algorithmic landscape of AI/ML, motivating a surge of techniques that parallelize computations previously assumed to be "inherently sequential". At the same time, compelling evidence suggests limits to parallelizability for some important tasks, prompting complementary advances in hardware-aware optimization of sequential algorithms and renewed interest in architectures where sequential computation is a first-class primitive. 

This workshop will convene researchers across many fields including probabilistic modeling, deep generative modeling, and deep sequence modeling to (i) establish a shared vocabulary connecting parallelization strategies across fields, (ii) distill best practices for implementing and profiling these methods on modern accelerators, (iii) formalize the definition of "inherently sequential", and (iv) clarify where parallel vs. sequential computation will matter most for future AI systems. 

The program will combine invited talks, panel debates, and contributed spotlights/posters.
